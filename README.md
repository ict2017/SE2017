FIFA Player Rating Database Management Project

In this project, I have created a website to manage FIFA players. Concretely, 
this system can handle information of players in the database, information on teams(
as well as manage transactions and expenses).
Main functions of the application:
-  Every user has an account (username and password), and they have to 
use this account to log in and use the system.
-   Show the list of players in the database.
-   Add, update and delete players in the database.
-  Add, update and remove teams in the database.
-  Search players by name and return results.
-  Show player info for each player.
-  Show the list of players sort by attacking position, midfield position, and 
defensive position.
-  Show the list of players with the same nation, team, squad number, 
league, overall rating.

Website is created using PHP.
PC Application is created using JAVA.
